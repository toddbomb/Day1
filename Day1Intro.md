Hello! This is the overview of Week 1. Please follow along with the daily schedule and complete the exercises and review the lecture notes.


# Tuesday

### Capstone Project Overview
Have you heard of the app Shazam? If you play some music, the app is able to accurately tell what song that is! It’s a pretty useful tool. However, the Amazon Alexa does not have this capability. So, we’re going to learn audio analysis and song fingerprinting from scratch in order to make an Alexa skill that can correctly identify songs. 

### Install Microphone and librosa
In order to run the code and do the exercises, you’ll need to install a few packages first. Download Microphone and follow the instructions on the page. Then, to install librosa, type in the following commands in your terminal.

#### Microphone:
 * Download [here](https://github.com/LLCogWorks2018/Microphone)

#### Librosa:
 `conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg` 
 `conda install -c conda-forge librosa`

### Physics of Sound/Audio Digitization and Encoding
* See lecture notes: 0_Overview.pdf and 1_Basic_Audio.pdf
* After you've read the lecture notes, try out these notebooks:
    - Day1Exercises- Microphone
    - Day1Exercises- AudioBasic
    - Also, see the Audio Figures notebook for some helpful visuals.

### Fourier Transforms 
 * See lecture notes: 2_Fourier_Basics.pdf
 * If you're confused, try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) video to further help visualize.
 * After you've read the lecture notes, try out this notebook:
     - Day1Exercises- FourierBasics

### Breakdown:
The main things you should take away from today are:
    - What sound waves are and how computers can interpret them through **sampling**
    - How we can represent any waves through Fourier Transforms, and how that is important for smoothing data.


# Preview of the coming week:

### On Wednesday:
 * Learning about spectrograms and finding peaks in 2D Data.
 
### On Thursday:
 * Learning about "fingerprinting" songs using peaks in the data and finding a method on how to match that accurately.
 * Beginning to work on the audio capstone project.

### On Friday:
 * Finishing working on the audio capstone project.

### Time and Frequency: Spectrograms (Ryan - intro; overview - Petar)
 * Spectrogram notebook

### Finding Peaks in 2D Data (None)
 * Puppy paw prints notebook
